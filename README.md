# React Blog Application

- This is a blog application built using React.js, featuring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing blog posts.
- It's the same as the previous blog app made by me only difference being the usage of Context API instead of easy-peasy redux.
- It uses Local Storage to save your posts.

## Features

- **React Router**: Enables navigation between different pages of the blog.
- **Custom Hooks**: Utilizes custom hooks for reusable logic and state management.
- **Context API & useContext hook**: Implements Context API & useContext hook for global state management.

## CRUD Operations

- **Create New Posts**: Add new blog posts with a title, content, and any relevant details.
- **Edit Existing Posts**: Modify the content of existing blog posts to update information.
- **Delete Posts**: Remove blog posts that are no longer needed.
